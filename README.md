## Inspiration
This hack reminded me of the physically disabled community who are still not benefitted by the technology, even some the students from our university whom I used to see daily. 
I got the inspiration from how Stephen Hawkins had to communicate when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. He was able to move only one finger and he had to tap on a key to form words which were then spelled through a speaker.

During this hack, I had a idea to relate this to people with mutism where people. In this case, people could use their complete hand and finger movements which could make communicating a lot faster.

## What it does
The user has to wear this device and tap on his finger with other fingers. Just like tapping on a virtual keyboard that is present on your hand. These key presses are then converted into characters with which could be seen on the screen present on the back of the users' hand. Autocomplete algorithm is used which can be used to complete words or even sentences. 

## How I built it
I used 3d modelling tools such as blender to make a virtual model of the device. 
Sketched and ideas are drawn showing the core functionalities of the device.
#### The circuit requires:
1. 3-D Printed device
2. Buttons

## Challenges I ran into
Electronics or any kind of hardware is not currently available from where I come, stores and shops are closed and even Amazon is not able to deliver any as my city is in a complete lockdown and is having the worst COVID condition in the world right now. Without having my hardware, I had to sketch out all the circuit diagrams and models.
